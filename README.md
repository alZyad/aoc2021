# aoc2021
My participation at AoC 2021. if you haven't heard of Advent of Code you can find out more information about the event here https://adventofcode.com/2021/about.

Having just started to learn Java i decided to take part of AoC 2021 using this language in order to get more comfortable with the syntax and the standard libraries.
