# aoc2021
My participation at AoC 2021. if you haven't heard of Advent of Code you can find out more information about the event [here.](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about)

Having just started to learn Java I decided to take part of AoC 2021 using this language in order to get more comfortable with the syntax and the standard libraries.

Each day has its own folder with each puzzle having its own file that prints the answer for both input and testInput files. input.txt files are the real source input while testInput.txt are arbitrary inputs for testing.
